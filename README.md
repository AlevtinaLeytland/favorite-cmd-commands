<h1>My favourite cmd commands</h2>

<h2>git init</h2>
<p>This command is used to create a new repository.It is used one time at the initial step. Also it creates .git subfolder in the current directory.</p>

<h2>git clone <repo url></h2>
<p>Is used to clone a new repository. We can use https or SSH protocol. Remote repository is copied to a new folder giving it the name of repository.</p>

<h2>git add</h2>
<p>With this command we choose the changed files of our working directory. It doesn't effect repository, but prepares files for commit.</p>

<h2>git commit</h2>
<p>This command should be executed with a comment (what changes did we do) and then it prepares files for pushing.</p>
